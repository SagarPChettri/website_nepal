                    <p class="fes-list-item-desc">Teej is an important and vibrant festival celebrated with great enthusiasm by women in Nepal. It usually falls in August or September and is dedicated to the goddess Parvati, symbolizing marital bliss, loyalty, and prosperity. Married
                        and unmarried women dress in red and green traditional attire and gather to observe a day-long fast for the well-being of their husbands and to seek blessings for a happy married life. During Teej, women engage in various cultural
                        activities like singing traditional songs, dancing, and swinging on beautifully decorated swings called "jhulas." The festival also provides an opportunity for women to bond and share their experiences. Teej is not only a celebration
                        of womanhood but also a reflection of Nepal's rich cultural heritage and the significance of family and marital relationships.</p>
